            <h1>What you should know</h1>
            <h2>Before traveling?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="mainContentDetailContainer">
            <div class="mainContentDetail">
                <h1>Have a plan</h1>
                <p>Traveling is an exciting adventure, which is why we like it so much. But just because it's an adventure doesn't mean we should rush into it.</p>
                <p>I strongly advocate having a plan for your travel. You don't have to plan every minute of the day, but you should plan your arrival and departure, first night's lodging, transportation to your first night's lodging, and how to exchange currencies.</p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h1>Handling Private Information</h1>
                <p>Tourists frequently repeat the same personal information when traveling. For instance, "My name is Gray, I'm 25 years old, I'm from Green Town, Ascent, and I work as an Software engineer," for example. Those four factors are enough for many persistent people to swiftly discover you on social media and perhaps stalk you.</p>
                <p>Make your information more ambiguous. You are now considerably more difficult to locate. I understand that the "getting to know you" chat is enjoyable when meeting new travel companions. You certainly may; just remember to keep your personal details unmemorable.</p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h1>Aware of Stranger</h1>
                <p>Remember that no one with bad intentions would tell you that they intend to injure you. As a result, even while meeting new acquaintances, you must be alert of warning signs. You deserve to be protected, therefore never allow someone to put you in an unsafe situation. Leave if anything doesn't feel right. Staying in groups and never going out with strangers alone is the greatest approach to create new, safe friends.</p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h1>Careful About The Food </h1>
                <p>Getting to experience new cuisines and drinks is one of the most wonderful pleasures of traveling. We may be more tempted to let free when we travel, but we cannot afford to overlook the same safeguards we would take at home. We are usually trained to be vigilant of food safety regulations in order to avoid becoming ill, but we occasionally forget that the threat might come from wicked persons. This is most typically encountered at pubs, clubs, and even during festivals. What should you do if you're in a pub and someone offers you a drink? Simply say NO if you don't want the drink.</p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h1>Behave Well</h1>
                <p>You can't act like a complete stupid just because you're on vacation. Wherever you go, you must regard it as if it were your own home. Respect various cultures, avoid becoming trashed when drinking, and be kind to natives. You should also follow the same safety precautions that you would in any city in your native country. Avoid unsafe areas, plan your route, don't travel alone at night, keep all valuables hidden, and so on. Your safety should always be at the top of your priority list and influence your decisions. </p>
